## Introduction

My PhD research spearheads the fight against gastric cancer by harnessing the power of multi-omics data integration and machine learning techniques. This dual approach not only aims to uncover the intricate biological interactions that predispose individuals to gastric cancer but also to develop robust, generalizable prevention strategies. By combining statistical genetics, epidemiology, biostatistics, metabolomics, and proteomics with causal stable learning, we are setting new standards in precision oncology and primary cancer prevention.

Our work has progressively garnered significant recognition, including the Best Oral Presentation Award at the 2023 AACR-KCA Joint Conference in Precision Oncology. Furthermore, it has been spotlighted at the Sino-German Annual Conference, evidencing its impact and the scientific community's interest in our innovative methodologies.

## The Role of Causal Stable Learning

Causal stable learning is pivotal to our research, enabling us to identify and understand the causal mechanisms underlying gastric cancer. This innovative approach helps ensure that the predictive models we develop are not only accurate but also stable across different populations and settings, a critical aspect when aiming for universal cancer prevention strategies. Through causal inference, we can differentiate between correlation and causation, allowing for the identification of genuine risk factors and intervention targets that hold true across diverse cohorts.
