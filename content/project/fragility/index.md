Our team has contributed to the development of an online tool designed for calculating the fragility index of clinical trials, which is particularly useful for meta-analysis studies. The fragility index is a measure that helps assess the robustness of the results of clinical trials. This tool aims to provide researchers and clinicians with an easy-to-use resource to evaluate the reliability of their findings.
