Our team has contributed to constructing a comprehensive dataset containing basic information of over 320,000 clinical trials from around the world. The primary source of this data is Clinicaltrials.gov. We have also created a specialized version of the dataset that only contains trials conducted in the U.S. This U.S. version of the data has been utilized to build an online Shiny app for visualization purposes. If you are interested in accessing the dataset or the Shiny app, please contact us for more information.
