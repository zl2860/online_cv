In this project, I built a predictive model based on Logistic Regression to facilitate cancer diagnosis. I trained Logistic Regression models with Newton Raphson and Gradient Descent algorithms from scratch in R (without using any packages). I decreased the misclassification rate by 4% by implementing a Logistic-LASSO Regression model with Path-wise Coordinate Descent.
