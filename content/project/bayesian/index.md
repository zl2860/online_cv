In this project, I implemented a Bayesian model using the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm to achieve a stationary distribution in a Markov Chain. I estimated parameters and the numerical standard error and constructed the 95% confidence interval from the results. The model was used to predict the spatial moving trends and wind speed of hurricanes.
